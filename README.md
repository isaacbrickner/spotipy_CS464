##### A light weight Python library for the Spotify Web API

![Tests](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?branch=master) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/spotipy/badge/?version=latest)](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## Documentation

Spotipy's full documentation is online at [Spotipy Documentation](http://spotipy.readthedocs.org/).

## Installation

```bash
pip install spotipy
```

alternatively, for Windows users 

```bash
py -m pip install spotipy
```

or upgrade

```bash
pip install spotipy --upgrade
```

## Quick Start

A full set of examples can be found in the [online documentation](http://spotipy.readthedocs.org/) and in the [Spotipy examples directory](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/tree/master/examples).

To get started, install spotipy and create an app on https://developers.spotify.com/.
Add your new ID and SECRET to your environment:

### Without user authentication

```python
import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyClientCredentials(client_id="YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID",
                                                           client_secret="YOUR_APP_CLIENT_SECRET"))

results = sp.search(q='weezer', limit=20)
for idx, track in enumerate(results['tracks']['items']):
    print(idx, track['name'])
```

### With user authentication

A redirect URI must be added to your application at [My Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) to access user authenticated features.

```python
import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth

sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth(client_id="YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID",
                                               client_secret="YOUR_APP_CLIENT_SECRET",
                                               redirect_uri="YOUR_APP_REDIRECT_URI",
                                               scope="user-library-read"))

results = sp.current_user_saved_tracks()
for idx, item in enumerate(results['items']):
    track = item['track']
    print(idx, track['artists'][0]['name'], " – ", track['name'])
```

## Troubleshooting user authentication

At times you may want to log in again or use another account for testing purposes. After authentication a .cache file will  be create in your directory containing the access token, refresh token, and api scope keywords. Deleting this file will then prompt your program to re-authenticate in case you wish to use another account.
